# Build a Cipher

### Description
The purpose of this assignment is to understand the
properties of a good cryptographic cipher and implement your
own cipher attempting to meet these standards.

### Written Portion
Answer the following questions:
1. What is confusion? What is diffusion? Why are these important
   properties of a crytographic cipher?
2. What is the difference between a block cipher and a stream
   cipher?
3. What is the difference between a symmetric key cipher and
   asymmetric key cipher?
4. What are common key sizes used in modern ciphers? Why are they
   these sizes?
5. Research into different components or mathematical operations of various ciphers. What do they accomplish?
    - Ask yourself whether each of these components affect:
      - Confusion
      - Diffusion
      - The key
    - Are these components part of a network?
    - Two examples of cipher components would be: S-boxes, 


### Cipher Design
You will be designing your own encryption cipher. 

Your encryption cipher must adhere to the following:
* Have a name
* Be a stream cipher or a block cipher
* Use symmetric keys or asymmetric keys
* Have a chosen key size
* Able to be reversed and thus decrypted
* Allow plaintext as an input
* Output ciphertext

Give details regarding the type of cipher you designed and the
attributes it has. Be sure to mention the key size, whether it
uses symmetric or asymmetric keys, and whether it is a block or stream
cipher.

Create a numbered list of components/mathematical operations
present in the cipher. This is where you will be including most of
the details of your design.
For each component, be sure to state:
* If the component was found from existing ciphers or was created by you
* How the component functions
* What the component accomplishes, especially regarding its
  effects on cryptographic properties like confusion and diffusion

You may take inspiration from various other ciphers or networks,
but make sure to get creative and personalize your cipher with
your own components or mathematical operations alongside 
components found while researching other ciphers.
